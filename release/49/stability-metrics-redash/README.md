Stability metrics relevant to the e10s add-ons experiment are monitored using a [re:dash dashboard](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/dashboard/stability-metrics-for-e10s-add-ons-experiment-release-49-) rather than in the notebooks.

Code and visualizations details for the relevant queries are maintained in stability-metrics.yaml, synced with re:dash using [this tool](https://github.com/dzeber/fill-redash-from-source/tree/generate-yaml).
